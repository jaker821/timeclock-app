## Exported Excel Files

- **Red cells** indicate manual overrides (e.g., missed clock-outs).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **App does not start:** Make sure `timeclock.db` exists or let the app create it on first run.
- **Image not found:** The logo file `resources/logo.png` is missing. The app will still run.
- **PIN issues:** PINs must be entered correctly; they are hashed.
- **Database errors:** The admin can restore a previous backup.

---

## Additional Notes

- All backups are stored in the `backups` folder.
- Old backups are automatically cleaned to keep a maximum of 500 backups.
- First-time setup requires an **Admin PIN**.
- The menu bar is only available for **admin users**.
